# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ankit.

I am deeply passionate about the field of Artificial Intelligence, where the intersection of machine learning, data, and human cognition continues to inspire my research journey. My primary focus lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP)—exploring how machines can understand, generate, and reason about human language. From large language models to semantic understanding, I am fascinated by the potential of language technologies to transform how we interact with information. In parallel, I am also drawn to Computer Vision (CV), where enabling machines to perceive and interpret visual data opens up a world of possibilities—from intelligent robotics to visual reasoning. I strive to contribute to AI systems that are not only powerful but also human-aligned, interpretable, and impactful in real-world applications.
