# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ankit.

I am very enthusiastic about Artificial Intelligence. The intersection of machine learning, data, and human intelligence drives my research adventure. My primary area of interest is Natural Language Processing (NLP). I investigate the possibilities of machines processing, producing, and reasoning about human language. I am intrigued by large language models and semantic processing. Language technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way we engage with information. Conversely, I am also interested in Computer Vision (CV). This area enables machines to perceive and make sense of visual information, which has a multitude of applications, ranging from intelligent robotics to visual reasoning. I am eager to contribute to the development of AI systems that are strong, human-friendly, interpretable, and applicable in the real world.
